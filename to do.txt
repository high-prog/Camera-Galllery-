1) Video Recording:
=> Browser APIs:
-> Media Stream API
        -> Navigator
        ->Media Devices
        -> Media Recorder
        -> canvas
        -> Indexed DB

TO DO: 
    -> Structuring(HTML + CSS) 
    -> camera captures-> stream => displayed inside video element in HTML
    -> video is available in chunks

    ->Image Capturing
    -> Filtering

    => Gallery feature
        -> Required Storage
    -> Indexed DB Api (powerful than local Storage)
        -> Client side Storage to store large volume of data
        -> Event Driven and asynchronous
        -> key value pairs {complex objects, videos, blobs, files can be stored}

        to implement:
            -> Factors:
                1)open Database
                    events=> 1. success
                            2. error
                            3. upgradeneeded
                2)create objectStore (like tables in sql) (can only be opened in upgradeneeded)
                    -> key Path = unique id for each unique data for identifiaction
                    -> make transactions => to perform operations(add, remove )
